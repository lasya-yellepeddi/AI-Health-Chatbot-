- Provides fixed advice or suggestions based on user keywords.
- Randomized responses to add variety.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**: Core programming language used to build the chatbot.
- **VS Code**: IDE used for development.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Initial development environment, later migrated to `.py` file.

## 📁 Files

- `healthbot.py` – The main Python script containing the chatbot logic.

## 📚 What I Learned

- Basics of building a text-based chatbot.
